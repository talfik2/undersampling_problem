# undersampling_problem
* In this repo, I tried the undersampling methods from the relevant article in Machine Learning Mastery.
* I cleaned my data, replaced Na values and encoded categorical values automatically & manually.
* I evaluated the methods with two of columns in my dataset; Transaction-ID & City and examined their outcomes.

* Here is the link of relevant article: https://machinelearningmastery.com/undersampling-algorithms-for-imbalanced-classification/?unapproved=608714&moderation-hash=b4584d50d33cda4761eefa4d36d2aebb#comment-608714

* I also added the dataset  as zip file so that you can interact my code fully and try to overcome my problem.
