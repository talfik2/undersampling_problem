# undersampling_problem
In this repo, I tried the undersampling methods from the relevant article in Machine Learning Mastery.

Here is the link of relevant article: https://machinelearningmastery.com/undersampling-algorithms-for-imbalanced-classification/?unapproved=608714&moderation-hash=b4584d50d33cda4761eefa4d36d2aebb#comment-608714

I also added the dataset so that you can interact my code fully and try to overcome my problem.
